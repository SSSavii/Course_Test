I was able to solve 3 problems, added tests to them
1. in this program, you enter a number and the same number of brackets.
the program checks whether they are written correctly and reports about it.
************************************************************************************************************************************************************************
2.in this program, you enter the number of cars and their numbers,
if they can be arranged in the correct order using this path (see the picture),
then the program will output yes otherwise no.
Be careful the program is limited to 100 wagons and wagon numbers should not be repeated

4.in this program, you enter the number of rectangles and their height into histograms (see the picture)
the program outputs the maximum area that can be obtained.
The height of the graphs should not be equal to 0 or negative.
